Outsourcing is a very common practice today - whether outsourcing a specific 
facet of your business, or a fringe business need.  However, have you done 
enough to protect your business and your customers data?  How much is enough?
This article will help answer these questions.  This article is part 2 of 2 on 
outsourcing practices, and deals more specifically with the pitfalls of 
outsourcing software development.


## Software Development Outsourcing 

A brief recap: Cybersecurity, or information security is a large topic with 
many facets. 

In this article, I would like to focus on the practice of outsourcing and the 
risks that it introduces.  Many of us are aware of the benefits of outsourcing: 
-  Outsourcing can significantly reduce the operating and development expenses 
   of a company.
-  It’s also a great way to reuse someone else's expertise without having to 
   make an investment in your own staff or product.


However, in today's environment where **data breaches** and associated 
liabilities are rampant, you need to be aware of the risks that come with 
outsourcing in order to mitigate that risk.

As with any risk management program, an organization needs to understand what 
is priority to be protected and what it’s relative worth is, in order to 
determine how best to protect it.  Also, the legal frameworks which may add 
requirements for your jurisdiction (ie/ GDPR, PIPEDA, HIPAA/HITECH, etc), or 
your customers jurisdictions, need to be considered.  Once this exercise is 
complete, we can move forward to determining risk and the value of the assets 
at risk. This discussion about priority and value of assets should be 
undertaken before  any discussion is made to outsourcing companies, as it may 
add to or drive some of the requirements for the outsourcer.

In many cases, regulations such as the GDPR, PIPEDA, and HIPAA/HITECH provide
guidance to understanding how best to protect and handle the information that 
end consumers entrust to us.

In the case for software outsourcing, the base contractual due diligence 
required (from a security perspective) is similar to those I’ve mentioned in 
the prior article [Outsourcing part 1 of 2 - Services](/security/outsourcing/2019/08/30/outsourcing-service.html) 
about service and product outsourcing.  Please visit [that article](/security/outsourcing/2019/08/30/outsourcing-service.html)
for more of that detail. 

With software outsourcing, the contractual and legal issues still apply.  The 
primary difference is the nature of the access being granted.  Software 
Developers will, necessarily, need to develop algorithms and routines in 
order to provide proper functionality. They will also need access to test data, 
test systems, and in some cases, production data and systems in order to 
troubleshoot problems. This level of access requires an inordinate amount of 
trust and access, places the outsourced developer deep into the data security 
realm, which is not that different from a direct employee. Said another way, 
the developer will understand, and have access to the innermost workings of 
your software and consequently represents significant risk to the organization. 

Outsourced development needs to have an appropriate level of in-house 
oversight to mitigate the potential risk posed by outsourced developers.

Threat vectors:
- Backdoor
- Denial of Service attacks
- Eavesdropping
- Privilege escalation
- Spoofing
- Tampering

Protections need to be put into place: 
- Independent quality assurance
- Independent software auditors
- Independent Source Code Control with commit approval process
- Ring-fenced development and testing systems
- Anonymized data and a process to create anonymized data for testing

These issues I’ve mentioned can be complex, (and I’ve just scratched the 
surface here), but they can be managed by having a managed information 
security program, which will ensure that your security stance is defined, 
kept intact, and maintained - whether you are outsourcing or not.

As I mentioned in my first paragraph, cybersecurity is a large topic and a 
cybersecurity practitioner has to be invested and kept current.  Organizations 
need to either have an in-house resource owning an information security program, 
or need to engage an outsourced cybersecurity resource.  In the latter case, 
all of the above points still apply.  

**Do your diligence!**
