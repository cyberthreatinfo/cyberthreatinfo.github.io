At a time when Cyber-crime tools are getting significantly more advanced
and sophisticated, a wide range of organizations across industries still
see cybersecurity as a significant financial cost rather than a
competitive/operational advantage. As we make the case for spending on
cybersecurity, we experts speak of possibilities and probabilities. If
one uses the traditional ROI methodologies, then it is easy to poke
holes or play devil’s advocate in any argument/discussion on
cybersecurity spending. We experts need to change the way cybersecurity
is perceived/positioned. Below I describe some of the top cybersecurity
threats, their effects on organizations and potential positioning.

**Top Cybersecurity Threats**

**·Malware:** Malware is a significant tool in the cyber-criminal's
arsenal. This nefarious software, whether they are: viruses, spyware,
keyloggers or worms, are intended to perform a variety of different
functions such as stealing, encrypting or deleting sensitive data,
altering or hijacking core computing functions and monitoring/spying on
users.

> **Positioning:**
>
> **§ What is the cost to the organization of: lost data, downtime and
> lost productivity?**
>
> **§ Quantify by calculating the real cost of losing key system(s) and
> being down for a day, week or month?**

**Phishing: **In a global survey, [*56% of IT decision makers say
targeted phishing attacks are their top security
threat*](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3153707/top-cybersecurity-facts-figures-and-statistics.html).
It’s a Cyber-crime in which a target or targets are contacted by email,
telephone or text message by someone posing as a legitimate institution
to lure employees into providing sensitive data like *banking and credit
card details*, and passwords.

> **Positioning:**
>
> **§ What is the cost to the organization of paying fraudulent
> invoices, or providing banking data to a criminal enterprise?**
>
> **§ Quantify by determining the typical size of invoice that would fly
> under the radar and be paid.**

**Ransomware:** Ransomware is a type of malware that threatens to
publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a
ransom is paid

> **Positioning:**
>
> **§ What would your organization be willing to pay to unlock key files
> or systems?**
>
> **§ Quantified above “the real cost of being down”.**
>
> **§ What is the cost to the organization of a public exposure of
> customer or employee PII (personally identifiable information)?**
>
> **§ This is harder to quantify and organization specific but requires
> you to determine the worst-case data exposure and its effect (dollars)
> on the organization.**

** **

**It should be noted that the “[Average total costs of a data breach
also varied heavily between countries with the United States the hardest
hit. In 2018, an average incident costs U.S. firms \$7.91 million while
in Canada and Germany, the impact is lower at less than \$5
million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2018/07/13/the-average-cost-of-a-data-breach-is-highest-in-the-u-s-infographic/#55fb20602f37)**”

This is not to say that a company should spend unfettered dollars on
cybersecurity but there should be a budget that is realistic and
proportional to the risk raised. The sample questions raised above help
put a value to the risk to determine proportionality. A successful
cybersecurity program is also shaped by the perception of its importance
and hence the role of “CISO” whether it be a dedicated employee, or a
virtual resource should report to the CEO and the CEO should espouse the
benefits/virtues of security.

While some accountants see cybersecurity as a black hole for dollars
with questionable ROI, it is important to shift the mindset and
present/position quantifiably cybersecurity as an indispensable part of
a business that can keep it competitive, trustworthy and operational.
