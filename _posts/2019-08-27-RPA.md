**What is robotic process automation?**

RPA is the application technology to programmatically replicate
repetitive work done by staff, to increase the capacity of current staff
or reduce staffing needs. The business logic, process and inputs are
mapped out and replicated within the RPA software. Using RPA tools, a
company can configure software aka a “bot / robot” to mimic what an
employee does via existing applications. Whether it be processing a
transaction, manipulating data and communicating with other systems (for
example creating monthly invoices, getting the input billable hours and
creating/submitting the invoice). RPA scenarios can range from something
as simple as generating automatic invoices to deploying hundreds of
bots, each programmed to automate jobs in complex environment.

**What are the Pros of RPA?**

-   **Improved job satisfaction and adding capacity**

    -   The intent of RPA is to alleviate employees of
        repetitive/monotonous tasks. This should/will leave the employee
        with more time to do more value-adding tasks. These tasks should
        be more stimulating to the employee and beneficial to
        the business.

-   **Reduced Errors**

    -   Businesses will see a reduction in the time needed to complete
        the repetitive tasks and as the process is now automated less
        errors in the output. Leading to both internal and external
        customer satisfaction.

-   **Reduced OPEX **

    -   The business may elect to reduce reducing headcount if the
        “robot” has taken over a job the function.

> or deep systems integration but still requires process analysis and
> familiarity with the software being used.

**What are the Cons of RPA?**

-   **Potentially High Maintenance**

    -   When using software that mimics a user’s use of an interface,
        any changes to the user interface will precipitate a change to
        the “bot”. If you have lots of “bots” they will require
        significant maintenance/updating.

-   **Employees feeling threatened at the possibility of unemployment
    due to automation**

    -   RPA has the potential to be a double-edged sword.
        Monotonous/repetitive tasks can be automated. However, if an
        employee’s job exists solely due to the monotonous/repetitive
        task they will feel threatened.

-   **Complex Integration/implementation**

    -   Implementing RPA needs proper research and thoughtful selection
        as “[63 percent of surveyed
        organizations](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/at/Documents/technology/at-technology-robots-are-ready.pdf)”
        did not meet delivery deadlines for RPA projects. Everything
        from improper expectations to changes in interfaces to simply
        poor planning result in unwanted outcomes.

**RPA Software Vendors**

RPA Tools/Vendors create the software used to configure robots to
automate tasks. The three top vendors in this arena are Blue Prism,
Automation Anywhere and UiPath,

**Opensource alternatives**

-   [TagUI](https://github.com/kelaberetiv/TagUI) is an open source,
    free to use RPA software. TagUI is maintained by [AI
    Singapore](https://www.aisingapore.org/), a Singapore
    government-funded initiative to build local Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) capabilities

-   [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) is an open source
    robotic free to use RPA software that is used to automate
    business processes. Robot’s core framework is a generic automation
    platform that is hugely popular in test automation and has an
    active community.
