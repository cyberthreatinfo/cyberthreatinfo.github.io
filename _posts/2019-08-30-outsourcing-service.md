Outsourcing is a very common practice today - whether outsourcing a specific 
facet of your business, or a fringe business need.  However, have you done 
enough to protect your business and your customers data?  How much is enough?
This article will help answer these questions.  This article is part 1 of 2 on outsourcing practices.


## Service Outsourcing 

Cybersecurity, or information security is a large topic with many facets. 

In this article, I would like to focus on the practice of outsourcing and the 
risks that it introduces.  Many of us are aware of the benefits of outsourcing: 

-  Outsourcing can significantly reduce the operating and development expenses 
   of a company.
-  It’s also a great way to reuse someone else's expertise without having to 
  make an investment in your own staff or product.


However, in today's environment where *data breaches* and associated liabilities 
are rampant, you need to be aware of the **risks** that come with outsourcing in 
order to mitigate that risk.  I will cover one aspect of outsourcing:
**Service/Product outsourcing**.  This is the outsourcing involved in utilizing
a company to fulfill a product or a service - for instance an e-commerce 
supplier for your products.


As with any risk management program, an organization needs to understand what 
is priority to be protected and what it’s relative worth is, in order to 
determine how _best_ to protect it.  Legal frameworks (if they apply) may add 
requirements for your jurisdiction (ie/ GDPR, PIPEDA, HIPAA/HITECH, etc), or 
*your customers* jurisdictions, need to be considered.  Once this exercise is 
complete, we can move forward to determining risk and the value of the assets 
at risk. This discussion about priority and value of assets should be 
undertaken **before**  any discussion is made to outsourcing companies, as it may 
add to or drive some of the requirements for the outsourcer.

In many cases, regulations such as the GDPR, PIPEDA, and HIPAA/HITECH provide 
guidance to understanding how best to protect and handle the information that 
end consumers entrust to us.

For service/product outsourcing, the biggest _effort_  occurs before entering 
into a formal agreement with the outsourcer, where due diligence should occur.
This effort can be intensive, as the intent is to discover poor practices, and 
poor protection in both your direct supplier and **their downstream providers**.
In some cases, it may lead to additional contract provisions.  It is worth 
noting however, that the requirement to keep your customers information private 
is with you, and it is your obligation to ensure that data is appropriately 
protected regardless of where it happens to be.

Here are some sample considerations:
-  How compliant are your suppliers relative to your obligations?
-  What geography do they operate in?  Is this permissible based on your 
   obligations?
-  What systems and data will they need access to?
-  Assuming the suppliers employees will have access to privileged data, how 
   does the supplier manage and control it’s employees accesses?  What are its 
   human resources and hiring policies?
-  What suppliers does your supplier subcontract to?  What is the state of 
   their information practices?  What are their policies? 
-  How is change managed? How is change notification and managed integrated 
   into your awareness and processes?
-  Diligence to ensure that the outsourced company will have best practice 
   protections
-  Diligence to ensure that the outsourced company will not share the 
   information with their information supply chain, or if it is, it’s clear 
   what is shared, when and you agree to it.
-  Diligence to ensure that the outsourced company has a clear breach 
   notification process
-  Diligence to ensure that you can request and remove your information from 
   the outsourcer

These are not small questions, but the answers (and timeliness of the answers) 
will tell a considerable amount about how the supplier has prepared for _their_ 
information security, and an indicator of how they will safeguard your 
information.


After having made a decision to choose a supplier and the appropriate vetting 
has been done, information integration needs to be considered, and as a 
best practice - recorded:
-  What information will the supplier have access to?
-  Which roles/departments at the supplier will have this access?
-  How will the suppliers change management process be integrated?

These issues I’ve mentioned can be complex, but they can be managed by having 
a managed information security program, which will ensure that your security 
stance is defined, kept intact, and maintained - whether you are outsourcing 
or not.

As I mentioned in my first paragraph, cybersecurity is a large topic and a 
cybersecurity practitioner has to be invested and kept current.  Organizations 
need to either have an in-house resource *owning* an information security 
program, or need to engage an outsourced cybersecurity resource.  In the latter
case, all of the above points still apply.  Do your diligence!
